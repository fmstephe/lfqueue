This is a lock-free concurrent queue implementation for Go. It does not provide safe dequeing and needs either a Java-style volatile read or some other synchronisation mechanism.

The implementation is based on the Michael-Scott algorithm described in the paper "Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms"

To see another real implementation of this algorithm have a look at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue.java
